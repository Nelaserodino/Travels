# Travels

Travels is a web application project that I created as part of my bootcamp training. The project served as a hands-on learning experience, allowing me to practice and explore various technologies, including ReactJS for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database.

## Project Overview

The goal of Travels was to create a platform for travel enthusiasts to share their travel experiences, stories, and photos. While the project may not be fully complete, it represents a significant milestone in my learning journey and serves as a playground for honing my skills in web development and automation testing.

## Key Technologies

- **Front-end:** Built with ReactJS, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Back-end:** Powered by Node.js, handling server-side logic and data interactions.
- **Database:** Utilizes MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **Automation Testing:** Currently, I am using Cypress for automation testing, allowing me to ensure the application's functionality remains robust as I continue to develop it.

## Automation Testing Repository

The repository for the Cypress automation tests related to this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Nelaserodino/Travels_Testing_Cypress). You can explore the automation code, run tests, and contribute to the testing effort to help ensure the project's reliability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/travels.git
Navigate to the project directory:

1.Navigate to the project directory:
cd travels
Install project dependencies:

2.Install project dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

3.Start the server:
cd server
npm start
Return to the main project directory:

4.Return to the main project directory:
cd ../

5.Start the client:
cd client
npm start

This command will launch the React client and Node.js server simultaneously, allowing you to access the application in your web browser.

## Project Status
As of now, Travels is a work in progress. While it may not have all the features of a fully-fledged travel-sharing platform, it continues to evolve as I gain more knowledge and experience in web development and testing.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute if you'd like. I welcome any feedback or suggestions to help improve this project.

Thank you for taking a look at Travels!
